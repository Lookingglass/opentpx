# OpenTPX - Threat Partner eXchange

OpenTPX is an open-source format and tools for exchanging machine-readable threat intelligence and network security operations data.  This is a JSON-based format that allows sharing of data between connected systems.

## Introduction

OpenTPX is a contribution by LookingGlass Cyber Solutions to the open source community. It defines a comprehensive model of threat associated with the global Internet enabling interconnected systems to exchange threat intelligence, threat context, collections, networks and threat mitigation information. OpenTPX is based on practical experience building highly scalable threat intelligence analysis & management systems deployed in real-world scenarios.

The OpenTPX specification, data model, data schema and supporting tools are freely available from [opentpx.org](http://www.opentpx.org)

## Contributing

We know there are folks out there that could use and expand the format, so we're open to pull requests. We can't promise the PR will be implemented exactly as requested, as managers of the format, we assume responsibility for making sure additions work without breaking the system. We'd like to avoid forks, so more than likely extensions that are submitted will make it into the system.
